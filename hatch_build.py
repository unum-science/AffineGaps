"""Compiles the Mojo extension into the wheel, when a Mojo toolchain is present.

The gate is whether the Mojo package imports, never a platform list: Modular ships wheels for
Linux x86-64, Linux aarch64 and macOS arm64 today and may add more, and anywhere it does not ship
one this hook simply produces the pure-Python wheel.

A freshly built extension records its runtime dependencies by absolute path into the build
environment, which the installer deletes afterwards, so the libraries are copied in beside it and
the loader is repointed at the wheel's own directory. Without that the wheel installs and then
fails to import.
