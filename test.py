"""
Test suite for affine gap alignment.

Every property that belongs to the algorithm is asserted against each backend, so the NumPy
reference and the compiled kernels are held to one standard rather than compared after the fact.
A test opts into that axis by naming a `backend` argument; `conftest.py` supplies the values and
skips the ones the machine cannot serve.

The suite leans on three kinds of oracle:

- __Self-consistency__, where the traceback's score must equal the score-only kernel's.
- __Cross-implementation__, where every backend must return what the reference returns.
- __External__, where BioPython and brute-force enumeration answer the same question independently.

The third kind matters most: the first two would agree with each other while both being wrong.
